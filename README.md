HI

I recently analyzed the GoodCabs dataset to assess the companyâ€™s performance across key metrics: trip volume, passenger satisfaction, repeat passenger rate, trip distribution, and the balance between new and repeat passengers. Using SQL for data extraction, Power BI for visualizations. I identified actionable insights to optimize operations and improve service quality

##**Key metrics **

Trip Volume & Distribution: Focused on understanding ride frequency and demand patterns across time (peak hours, weekdays vs weekends) and regions.

Passenger Distribution: Analyzed the total number of new vs repeat passengers and calculated the repeat passenger rate.

New to Repeat Passenger Ratio: Explored the balance between acquiring new customers and retaining repeat customers.

Tool and approach

SQL: Used for data extraction, aggregation, and querying key metrics.

Power BI: Created interactive dashboards to visualize trends in trip volume, satisfaction, and more.

POWER POINT: Designed a professional report to present the findings effectively

Insights
